# Autonomous-Bartendar-Robotic-Arm-on-Chassise

Liquibot is an autonomous bartending robot
designed to replicate the complete drink preparation process,
from syrup handling to serving. Mounted on a mecanum-wheeled
base capable of omnidirectional motion, Liquibot features a
robotic arm that performs complex bartending tasks such as
pouring various liquids, adding ice cubes, stirring or shaking
drinks, and accurately dispensing water into a glass. The robot is
designed to operate in a structured environment using visual
markers and pre-defined trajectories for precise localization and
manipulation. By integrating advanced control systems, ROS-
based automation, and custom mechanical design, Liquibot aims
to deliver interactive and efficient robotic bartending experience.



Liquibot is inspired by the infamous Makr Shakr bartending
robot, known for its ability to mix and serve drinks using two 6+
DOF robotic arms. We were intrigued by the idea and wanted to
explore whether similar levels of slosh control and drink-making
precision could be achieved on a mobile platform. The thought
of having a bartending system on wheels opened up exciting
possibilities, especially in terms of increasing reach and
accessibility in a larger workspace.
Liquibot is designed as an autonomous robotic bartending
system capable of navigating, detecting, and serving beverages
in a semi-structured environment. The robot features a 5-DOF
robotic arm mounted on a mecanum-wheeled base, enabling
omnidirectional movement in eight directions across the planar
surface. This setup allows the robot to move freely around a
space, align itself accurately with drink stations, and carry out a
variety of bartending tasks.
Our goal is to have Liquibot autonomously localize a cup,
navigate to its location, and successfully pick it up using real-
time perception and inverse kinematics (IK). By combining
mobility and manipulation, we aim to bring a new level of
autonomy and adaptability to robotic bartending.
